        <h2>- ELEMENTARY</h2>
        <p>I studied at Trece Martires City Elementary School and graduated in special science class, with honor on year 2017. As a elementary student I remember that I only go to school just to play with my friends.</p>

        <h2>- HIGHSCHOOL</h2>
        <p>I studied at Cavite Science Integrated School in Maragondon, Cavite and graduated with honor on year 2021. I study in regional science school and as a student it is pure hardwork and it is hard to maintain grade since they have high standards.</p>

        <h2>-SENIOR HIGHSCHOOL <br> </h2>
        <p>I studied at Notre Dame Trece Martirez Branch and graduated with honor on year 2023. It is my first time studying in a private school. It is a great experience for me because they have different perspective in the way of teaching.</p>

        <h2>- COLLEGE</h2>
        <p>I am currently studying at Cavite State University Trece Martires Branch, taking BSIT or Bachelor of Science Major in Information Technology. <br> <br> To be honest BSIT is not my first choice of course, I take my entrance exam in main campus for Mechanical engineering but sadly I didn't pass and not enough slots.</p>
