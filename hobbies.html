        <li>Photography was my favourite hobby when I was a student. It not only allows you to capture moments but also helps develop a keen eye for detail. I loved exploring my university city with my camera! </li>
        <li>Biking stands out as a fantastic choice for students looking for an interesting hobby that also keeps them fit. Itâ€™s a fun way to explore new interests, offering the chance to discover local trails or city bike paths.</li>
        <li>Engaging with literature also enhances problem-solving skills as you unravel complex narratives or digest new information. You could join a book club online or within your college community, meeting new people who share similar interests.</li>
